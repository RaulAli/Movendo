/* Styling for app-carousel with class "main-carousel" */
app-carousel.main-carousel {
    // This carousel is likely acting as the Highlighted Categories section
    // The internal styling of the carousel items will be handled by the carousel component itself.
    // We just ensure it's displayed correctly within the home page flow.
    display: block;
}

/* Styling for list-category (Categories Carousel Section) */
list-category {
    display: block;

    // If list-category is meant to have a title and a carousel like the React example:
    // We assume list-category and list-evento will contain their own sections, titles, and carousels/grids.
    // The SCSS here primarily sets up the layout for the HomePage itself.
}

/* Styling for list-evento (Events Grid Section) */
list-evento {
    display: block;

    // Similar to list-category, this will contain its own section, title, and grid.
}

/*
  Since the provided HTML is very high-level and uses custom Angular components
  (<app-carousel>, <list-category>, <list-evento>), this SCSS focuses on the
  layout of the HomePage component itself, applying the `container mx-auto px-4 py-8 space-y-16`
  styling from the React HomePage.tsx.

  The internal styling for the cards and specific carousel behaviors will need
  to be applied within the SCSS of `app-carousel`, `list-category`, and `list-evento`
  components respectively, mimicking the `Carousel.tsx`, `CategoryCard.tsx`,
  `EventCard.tsx`, and `HighlightedCategoryCard.tsx` files.

  Let me know when you want to move on to styling the individual components
  like app-carousel, list-category, and list-evento, and I can help you translate
  the Tailwind CSS from the React components into SCSS for your Angular components.
